# Descriptions-yt

This flask webapp python project aims to simplify the editing of some of your Youtube video descriptions with just a few clicks.
For content creators, this is a significant time-saver, whether for affiliate links / partnerships / materials etc.

This webapp uses the Youtube API and Google OAuth to identify you and gain access to your videos. 
To finance the project and make up for Youtube and Google's quotas, there's a payment area via Stripe. 
⏱️ 3-day challenge from idea to online launch.

## Warning ⚠️

Some elements of the webapp may no longer be up to date, and security flaws may be dangerous. I haven't made any major changes since then. 
Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any problems or bugs that could help us improve this little project.
